<p>This document attempts to describe the processes that should be followed by the various libseccomp maintainers. It is not intended as a hard requirement, but rather as a guiding document intended to make it easier for multiple co-maintainers to manage the libseccomp project.</p>
<p>We recognize this document, like all other parts of the libseccomp project, is not perfect. If changes need to be made, they should be made following the guidelines described here.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
Reviewing and Merging Patches</h2>
<p>In a perfect world each patch would be independently reviewed and ACK'd by each maintainer, but we recognize that is not likely to be practical for each patch. Under normal circumstances, each patch should be ACK'd by a simple majority of maintainers (in the case of an even number of maintainers, N/2+1) before being merged into the repository. Maintainers should ACK patches using a format similar to the Linux Kernel, for example:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">Acked-by: John Smith &lt;john.smith@email.org&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The maintainer which merged the patch into the repository should add their sign-off after ensuring that it is correct to do so (see the documentation on submitting patches); if it is not correct for the maintainer to add their sign-off, it is likely the patch should not be merged. The maintainer should add their sign-off using the standard format at the end of the patch's metadata, for example:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">Signed-off-by: Jane Smith &lt;jane.smith@email.org&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The maintainers are encouraged to communicate with each other for many reasons, one of which is to let the others when one is going to be unreachable for an extended period of time. If a patch is being held due to a lack of ACKs and the other maintainers are not responding after a reasonable period of time (for example, a delay of over two weeks), as long as there are no outstanding NACKs the patch can be merged without a simple majority.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
Managing Sensitive Vulnerability Reports</h2>
<p>The libseccomp vulnerability reporting process is documented in the SECURITY.md document.</p>
<p>The maintainers should work together with the reporter to asses the validity and seriousness of the reported vulnerability. Whenever possible, responsible reporting and patching practices should be followed, including notification to the <em>linux-distros</em> and <em>oss-security</em> mailing lists.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros">https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
Managing the GitHub Issue Tracker</h2>
<p>We use the GitHub issue tracker to track bugs, feature requests, and sometimes unanswered questions. The conventions here are intended to help distinguish between the different uses, and prioritize within those categories.</p>
<p>Feature requests MUST have a "RFE:" prefix added to the issue name and use the "enhancement" label. Bug reports MUST a "BUG:" prefix added to the issue name and use the "bug" label.</p>
<p>Issues SHOULD be prioritized using the "priority/high", "priority/medium", and "priority/low" labels. The meaning should hopefully be obvious.</p>
<p>Issues CAN be additionally labeled with the "pending/info", "pending/review", and "pending/revision" labels to indicate that additional information is needed, the issue/patch is pending review, and/or the patch requires changes.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
Managing the GitHub Release Milestones</h2>
<p>There should be at least two GitHub milestones at any point in time: one for the next major/minor release (for example, v2.5), and one for the next patch release (for example, v2.4.2). As issues are entered into the system, they can be added to the milestones at the discretion of the maintainers.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md12"></a>
Managing the Public Mailing List</h2>
<p>The mailing list is currently hosted on Google Groups, and while it is possible to participate in discussions without a Google account, a Google account is required to moderate/administer the group. Those maintainers who do have a Google account and wish to be added to the moderators list should be added, but there is no requirement to do so.</p>
<p>Despite the term "moderator" the list is currently unmoderated and should remain the way.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md13"></a>
Handling Inappropriate Community Behavior</h2>
<p>The libseccomp project community is relatively small, and almost always respectful and considerate. However, there have been some limited cases of inappropriate behavior and it is the responsibility of the maintainers to deal with it accordingly.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the maintainers are encouraged to communicate with each other, and this communication is very important in this case. When inappropriate behavior is identified in the project (e.g. mailing list, GitHub, etc.) the maintainers should talk with each other as well as the responsible individual to try and correct the behavior. If the individual continues to act inappropriately the maintainers can block the individual from the project using whatever means are available. This should only be done as a last resort, and with the agreement of all the maintainers. In cases where a quick response is necessary, a maintainer can unilaterally block an individual, but the block should be reviewed by all the other maintainers soon afterwards.</p>

New Project Releases</h2>
<p>The libseccomp release process is documented in the RELEASE_PROCESS.md document. </p>
